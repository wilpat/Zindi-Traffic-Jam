# Zindi-Traffic-Jam
Machine learning challenge for predicting the  number of tickets to be bought over the next few weeks

Full info about this challenge can be found [here](https://zindi.africa/competitions/traffic-jam-predicting-peoples-movement-into-nairobi)

I created two notebooks, one using [fastai's](https://www.fast.ai) library and the other is bare boned.
But for some reason, the bareboned approach that has minimal feature engineered columns makes better predictions

## N.B:
You can only run the fast.ai notebook successfully if you pull in their github repo(sucks, i know)
